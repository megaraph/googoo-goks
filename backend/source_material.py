Teaching Strategies to Unify Concepts and Big Ideas in Mathematics
1. Importance of Strong Foundations
Weak mathematical foundations lead to poor learning outcomes.
Examples from TIMSS and PISA results show the need for improvement in foundational math skills in the Philippines.
2. Big Ideas in Mathematics
Definition: Concepts that are mathematically, conceptually, and pedagogically significant.
Examples include:
Numbers: Representing and understanding numbers as quantities.
Representations and Communications: Translating mathematical objects visually and symbolically.
Equivalence: Different representations with the same value or meaning.
Relationships: Connections between concepts to generate new properties.
Operations and Transformations: Actions on objects/statements to model situations.
3. Development of Mathematical Understanding
Use a Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach for teaching:
Concrete: Physical objects (e.g., base-10 blocks).
Pictorial: Visual representations (e.g., drawings, number lines).
Abstract: Symbols and equations.
4. Curriculum and Competency Goals
Align learning competencies with performance standards (e.g., counting, recognizing, and representing numbers up to 100 for Grade 1).
5. Examples of Big Ideas in Action
Multiple representations of numbers: "27" as "2 tens and 7 ones" or "twenty-seven."
Real-world connections through mathematical variability and multiple embodiments.
6. Teaching Strategies
Explicit instruction: "I Do, We Do, You Do."
Multiple exposures and scaffolding for mastery.
Emphasizing reasoning, proof, and relationships to foster deeper understanding.
7. Key Takeaways
Big Ideas are enduring, interrelated, and essential for curriculum coherence.
Teaching with Big Ideas promotes mathematical proficiency, mastery, and real-world connections.
