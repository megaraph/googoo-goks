"Using the concrete, pictorial and abstract approach in teaching. I think I can apply this approach teaching polygons. First by showing students polygons in real-world objects, like tiles, windows, or road signs. Then students will identify and discuss the polygons they see around them. In pictorial stage, I will use charts or diagrams to illustrate different types of polygons and their properties. Then the students will draw polygons, labeling their sides and angles. Lastly, teach students the formal definitions of polygons and their properties.",6.0,5.0,0,0,True
"To teach the ""Big Ideas"" in math, which is super important!  I'd say the most effective way is to make it relatable and engaging.Start with real-world examples:  Instead of just throwing equations at students, I'd find ways to connect those ideas to their lives.  Like, for geometry, we could talk about how shapes are everywhere – in buildings, art, even nature!  For algebra, we could use examples of how equations help us solve problems like budgeting or figuring out how much paint we need for a room.Make it interactive:  I'd use games, puzzles, and activities to help students learn by doing.  For example, we could play a game where they have to use their knowledge of fractions to divide a pizza fairly.  Or, we could create a model of a city using blocks and then use geometric concepts to calculate its volume.",6.0,4.0,0,0,True
"1. Conceptual Understanding through Visual ModelsHow it works: Using visual models like number lines, graphs, and geometric shapes helps students see the abstract concepts in a tangible way. For instance, when teaching fractions, visual aids like pie charts or fraction bars can clarify the relationship between the parts and the whole.Implementation: I would integrate visual tools in almost every lesson, starting with simple concepts like addition and moving to more complex ideas like algebra. For example, when introducing quadratic equations, I’d use graphs to show how the equation models a parabola, helping students connect the algebraic and geometric representations.",6.0,4.0,0,0,True
"To convey big ideas in Mathematics to my students, i will first explain each small parts of the big idea to them, to let students see and realize the significance of each and every part, making the big idea more understandable. I will also use models to abstract, applying inductive method.",3.0,3.0,0,0,False
